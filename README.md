# Problem Statement
Fibr Quiz: Create API for a quiz app

- A user (creator)should be able to log in and create multiple quizzes. Questions in the quiz are multiple choice questions with one or more correct answers. User should be able to share the quiz with other.

- Others (participants)can take the quiz, using the link shared by the creator and will be awarded score based on the results. The creator should be able to view the list of participants and their scores.

The objective is to create a restful API for a quiz app. For authentication, you can use any third party like autho or cognito if needed.

Make sure you commit code to GitHub at regular intervals. Adding unit tests will be a bonus.
Please make sure you deploy this and share the running instance, and Postman collection to verify it.
